            %h1 Al Jaffee: Unfolded
            %p Al Jaffee began his long and illustrious career in comics in 1941 with the “inferior man” feature for Quality Comics. He later joined his high-school pal Harvey Kurtzman at Mad Magazine in 1955, and went on to create hundreds of features for MAD, including the iconic “Mad Fold-In” and “Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions.” Now, at age 93, he has contributed to 480 issues of the magazine, more than any other mad artist.

            %p Jaffee will be interviewed by Michael Kupperman, a cartoonist of whom Conan O’Brien said “this guy may have one of the best comedy brains on the planet.”
